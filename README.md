# College Management System (DBMS)
Database Management System (DBMS) for College

# Problem Statement:
A college contains many departments. Each department can offer any number of courses. Many instructors can work in a department, but an instructor can work only in one department. For each department, there is a head, and an instructor can be head of only one department. Each instructor can take any number of courses, and a course can be taken by only one instructor. A student can enrol for any number of courses and each course can have any number of students.
In the above-stated raw problem, you need to play the role of a user as well as the developer and develop the mini-project from scratch. The project should meet all design goals from the general user perspective from start to end. Therefore you should need to strictly adhere following conditions while developing the project:

1. Identify all of the entities which will be useful in order to complete the goal of the project with respect to the perspective of the general user.
2. Design an ER-Diagram to draw a relationship between each of the entities.
3. Convert the ER-Diagram to 3NF tables.
4. Design a working module which includes the front-end and back-end to achieve the goal of the project. Some of the goals are as follows:
a. Create a Web interface for data manipulation (insert, update and delete)
b. Create a web interface to access the records based on the role of users (such as account info can be accessed by account personal as well as by admin)
c. Develop a web interface to specify the schedule of exams and also show the performance of particular student marks.
d. Develop a web interface for faculty for marks evaluation as well as marks update.
e. Apart from this, please use your own intuition to add further modules.
5. Also add indexing concept to enhance the model performance.
